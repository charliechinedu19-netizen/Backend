### Updating the spec

When you add or change a route, update `docs/openapi.yaml` in the same PR. The `api-contract` CI job will lint the spec and run smoke tests automatically.

### Breaking-change policy

This API follows semantic versioning. Breaking changes (removed fields, changed response shapes, new required parameters) increment the major version and are announced at least two weeks before release.
